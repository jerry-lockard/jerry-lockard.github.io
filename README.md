## About Me

👋 **Hello**, I’m **@Lexington-KY-40507** – a dedicated coder, political science student, and aspiring politician based in *Lexington, KY*. Currently, I’m working as a substitute teacher for FCPS and pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Political Science at **[Eastern Kentucky University](https://www.eku.edu/)**. My **long-term goal** is to collaborate with organizations in the tech and social media sectors, such as **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/)**, **[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/explore)**, **[Google](https://www.google.com/)**, or **[Gradle](https://gradle.com/)**, and contribute to the development of decentralized social media platforms. I’m also open to opportunities at **[X](https://x.com)**, where I can combine my passion for technology and political science to drive meaningful change in the world.

## Coding and Projects

My journey into coding began during the COVID-19 lockdown, where I discovered a profound interest in technology. Though I’m still in the learning phase, my enthusiasm for coding and understanding the intricacies of technology continues to grow. I dedicate much of my free time to designing apps and websites, primarily using Flutter and Dart, with recent explorations into [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

Currently, I’m focused on developing **Nottyboi**, a decentralized social media platform tailored for gay men over 18+. This platform is designed to offer a secure and welcoming environment for connection and expression.

### Future Aspirations

With **Nottyboi**, my vision is to build a vibrant and supportive community for gay men, where they can connect, share, and engage without compromising their privacy and security. Drawing from my background in political science, I aspire to use this platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and drive positive social change.

### Get in Touch

I’m always open to collaborations, discussions about technology, or conversations about political science and social change. Let’s work together to make the world a better place through technology and proactive initiatives!
